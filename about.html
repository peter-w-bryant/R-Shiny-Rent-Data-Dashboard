        <h3 id="description">Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            This application was created as a final project for <span style="font-weight:bold">STAT 436: Data
                Visualization</span> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Spring 2023.
            As a team, we acted as a contracted, third-party design studio, with the goal of designing an interface to
            assist the fictitious <span style="font-style:italic">Badger Real
                Estate Group </span>(BREG) in reaching its analysis goals of reducing the risk of an unsuccessful and
            unprofitable collection of U.S. real estate investments.
            <br><br>
            The entire application and all visualizations were prepared using <span style="font-weight:bold">R</span>
            and the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" style="font-weight:bold">Shiny</a> package.
            All source code and data used to create the interface can be found <a href="#download">below</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="visualizations">Interfaces/Visualizations</h3>
        <p>
            In total there are two separate interfaces, <span style="font-weight:bold">State Analysis</span> and <span
                style="font-weight:bold">County Analysis</span>, each with their own set of interactive
            visualizations.
        </p>

        <h4 id="state-analysis">State Analysis</h4>
        <p> This interface allows a user to compare four separate variables across all mainland states in the United
            States. When a variable is selected from
            the options:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Education Spending</li>
            <li># Citizens Per Hospital</li>
            <li>Median Home Prices</li>
            <li>Median Days on the Market</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            a heat map of the U.S. is rendered where each state is colored by its value of the selected variable in
            relation to all other states. Some of these variable values
            come from different data sources for different years, more on this under <a href="#data-sources">Data
                Sources</a>.
            <br><br>
            Beyond just the heat map that is rendered, there is also a bar plot showing all states sorted in descending
            order by their value of the selected variable below the map.
            This bar plot is interactive, allowing the user to quickly hover over each bar to quickly see the values of
            the selected variable for each state, and is color coded
            to consistently match the color of the state on the map.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, there are supplemental visualizations that are rendered when the user selects either "Median
            Home Prices" and "Median Days on the Market" from
            the variable selection options.
        </p>

        <h5 id="home-prices">Median Home Prices Line Plot</h5>
        <p>
            The median home prices line plot is rendered when the user selects "Median Home Prices" from the variable
            selection options. When no state is selected this
            plot shows the median home prices for all states in the U.S. between 2016 and 2022. When a state is
            selected, the plot shows the median home prices for just
            that state in the same time period.
        </p>

        <h5 id="home-prices">Median Days on the Market Seasonal Plot</h5>
        <p>
            The median days on the market seasonal plot is rendered when the user selects "Median Days on the Market"
            from the variable selection options. When no state is selected this
            plot is hidden, but when a state is selected, the plot shows the median days on the market for just
            that state in the same time period.
        </p>

        <h5 id="weighted-sum">Weighted Sum Map</h5>
        <p>
            An additional variable we included in the state analysis interface is heat map colored by a weighted sum of the four variables.
            If a user selects "Weighted Sum" from the variable selection options, a heat map is rendered where each state is colored by its value of the weighted sum of
            the four other variables, in relation to all other states. The weights used for the weighted sum are initially initialized to 0.25 for each variable,
            but the user can modify this using the select input above the map for each variable. When the weights for any of the variables is modified, both the 
            heat map and the bar plot are updated to reflect the new weighted sum.
            <br><br>
            This weighted sum is normalized to be between 0 and 1 across all states, meaning the state with the highest weighted sum will have the value 1, 
            and the state with the lowest weighted sum will have the value 0. This normalization is done using the following formula:
            <br><br>
            <span style="font-weight:bold">Normalized Weighted Sum = (Weighted Sum - Minimum Weighted Sum) / (Maximum Weighted Sum - Minimum Weighted Sum)</span>
        </p>
