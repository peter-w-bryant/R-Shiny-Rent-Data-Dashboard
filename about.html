        <h3 id="description">Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            This application was created as a final project for <span style="font-weight:bold">STAT 436: Data
                Visualization</span> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Spring 2023.
            As a team, we acted as a contracted, third-party design studio, with the goal of designing an interface to
            assist the fictitious <span style="font-style:italic">Badger Real
                Estate Group </span>(BREG) in reaching its analysis goals of reducing the risk of an unsuccessful and
            unprofitable collection of U.S. real estate investments.
            <br><br>
            The entire application and all visualizations were prepared using <span style="font-weight:bold">R</span>
            and the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" style="font-weight:bold">Shiny</a> package.
